# WAC_Corporal

This project is my first backend experience, and I'm excited to share my progress and learning journey with the community.

## 🚀 About

WAC_Corporal is a backend application developed in **Java**. The main purpose is to explore backend technologies, gain practical experience, and continuously improve the project as I learn more. The codebase is kept clean and up-to-date, and unnecessary files or configs have been removed for clarity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Maven**
- **(Spring Boot, JPA, or other frameworks if used — specify here)**
- **JUnit** (for testing, if present)
